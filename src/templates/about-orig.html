            The Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments were developed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, UNC Asheville’s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center, and NatureServe. These Assessments allow NFWF and its partners to identify large public and private coastal lands ideal for restoration and analyze their potential to provide maximum protection to human communities while also restoring or improving habitat for fish and wildlife. They utilize data available at the national level, ensuring a consistent and contiguous dataset for U.S. coastlines but allowing the information to also be used locally by communities to inform resilience planning and project development. This information then guides the implementation of the National Coastal Resilience Fund.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Assessments currently span U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coastlines.  Assessments are underway in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

                    The Resilience Hubs analysis, is the result of a landscape suitability assessment guided by the Community Exposure Index and the Fish and Wildlife Index. Resilience Hubs are to be used to identify optimal sites for restoration or conservation actions, and generally put, are considered priority open spaces that have the potential to provide benefit to both human communities and fish and wildlife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To determine a Resilience Hub, the analysis considers only contiguous, open space landscapes that are: (1) Near a high density patch of exposed assets
                    (2) Area a minimum of 100-acres in area within 5-km of the projected 5-ft sea level rise or Category-5 storm surge flooding scenarios
                    or (3) At least 5,000 acres in area if outside those scenarios. In developing Resilience Hubs, careful attention was given to each region in identifying suitable open space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Resilience Hubs are ranked by the combined averages of both the Community Exposure Index and the Fish and Wildlife Index for the lands within the Hub and the areas within 1-km of the Hub. As the Hubs are non-developed natural landscapes, this 1-km area around the Hub is included to address the potential impact a Hub may have on nearby community or wildlife assets. The rankings for each Index determine the Hub’s priority as a potential resilience-building site. This is a simple calculation: Average Community Exposure × Average Fish & Wildlife = Resilience Hub ranking.

                    Flood-related datasets are used to help communities understand what kind of threats are potentially present in their area. While other threats may exist, for purposes of this analysis only those threats relevant to flooding were included. Included datasets range from periodic threats, such as Inundation from Storm Surge, to those that give better context to regional landscape characteristics and are more permanent, such as Low-Lying Areas. As the assessment grew, it evolved to incorporate regionally specific hazards, such as Geologic Stressors, that may impact a community’s ability to handle flood events. To determine the most suitable data inputs for this analysis, the foundational work from Gornitz, et al. and the New Jersey Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping Protocol, and others, were referenced.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Using an ordinal combination method, all of the inputs were ranked numerically from low to high, representing the risk—not the degree—of impact. Each ranked input is used to create the cumulative Threat Index. The Threat Index is then reclassified into ten classes using a percentile distribution.

                    When considering datasets for the Community Asset Index, two important rules were followed:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      The asset must be linked to its potential ability to allow a community to respond to a flood event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The asset must have data available at a regional scale.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Following these rules, the Community Asset Index was created using datasets that quantify the number of assets present—not their degree of vulnerability or susceptibility to flood threats. Datasets chosen include human asset inputs, such as population density and social vulnerability, as well as critical facilities and infrastructure that help communities respond to flood events, such as a hospital or police or fire station. The use of these data aims to facilitate more informed decision making, particularly on the coasts, where many major U.S. metropolitan areas are located. The Community Asset Index was ultimately reclassified into ten classes using a percentile distribution.

                    To create the Community Exposure Index, the Threat and Community Asset Indices were each given a value of 1 to 10 to indicate a low to high presence of assets or threats. Combination methods traditionally result in an addition of inputs to create a final land suitability index; however, this assessment aims to understand exposure—the relationship between potential threats and the presence of community assets. Therefore, a multiplication function was used to understand this relationship. Areas with highest prevalence of threats and the highest presence of community assets were calculated as having the highest levels of exposure.

                    The Terrestrial Index and the Aquatic Index. The index identifies areas on the landscape where priority species and their habitats are located.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For each Index, a Rarity Weighted Richness (RWR) calculation based on NatureServe species occurrence data was completed for the contiguous United States at the HUC-10 watershed level. RWR is a useful measurement for prioritizing sites in large datasets. The calculation assigns each species a rarity value that is the inverse of the number of watersheds in which it occurs. All of the species rarity values for each watershed are then summed to yield one value per watershed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In creating the Aquatic Index, Critical Habitat designated by NOAA, and NOAA Fisheries Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (HAPC) and Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) datasets were included, in addition to NatureServe species data. EFH is identified for species managed in Fishery Management Plans under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; it is the habitat necessary for managed fish to complete their life cycles. HAPCs are considered a high priority for conservation, management, or research because they provide important ecological functions and are particularly vulnerable to degradation. These datasets are all combined to create the Aquatic Index.

                  <p>
                    In addition to the RWR based on NatureServe species occurrence data, the Terrestrial Index includes  BirdLife International Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of global and continental rank with IBAs are measured with a presence value. The IBA program is a global initiative for sites critical to the conservation of birds. IBA designations are not legally binding, but they can support habitat conservation through acquisitions or easements or by encouraging the voluntary adoption of best management practices. The RWR score comes together with the IBA presence value to create the Terrestrial Index.
