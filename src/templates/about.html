    <div class="about-main-text flex-fill ">
      The Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments were developed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, UNC Ashevilleâ€™s National Environmental Modeling Analysis Center and NatureServe. These Assessments allow NFWF and their partners to identify large public and private coastal lands ideal for restoration, and analyze their potential to provide maximum protection to human communities while also restoring or improving habitat for fish and wildlife. They utilize data available at the national level, ensuring a consistent and contiguous dataset for U.S. coastlines, but allow the information to also be used locally by communities to inform resilience planning and project development. This information then guides the implementation of the National Coastal Resilience Fund.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The Assessments currently span U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coastlines and will be available for the public in early 2019. The partnership will also complete Assessments for Puerto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii in 2019.

              The NFWF Assessment Web Tool provides access to the Assessment datasets through an online, interactive environment. The main functions of the Web Tool are to allow users to 1) view and explore key Assessment datasets within their own areas of interest, 2) use the data exploration tools to analyze known potential project sites and quantity results from the Assessment models, 3) search resilience hubs to identify potential locations for proposed project sites, and 4) provide advanced GIS users the ability to download all of the final Assessment datasets for use in their own GIS platform.

        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">The process of adjusting to new (climate) conditions in order to reduce risks to valued assets. <div>&nbsp</div></div>

        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">The ability of a person, asset, or system to adjust to a hazard, take advantage of new opprtunities, or cope with change.<div>&nbsp</div></div>
        <div class="col-2 term"><h6>Assets</h6></div>
        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">People, resources, ecosystems, infastructure, and the services they provide. Assets are the tangible and intangible things people or communities value.<div>&nbsp</div></div>

        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">A condition, event, or trend related to climate variability and change that can exacerbate hazards.<div>&nbsp</div></div>
        <div class="col-2 term"><h6>Consequence</h6></div>
        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">A subsequent result (usually negative) that follows from damage to or loss of an asset. Quantifying potential consequences is an important part of determining risk.<div>&nbsp</div></div>
        <div class="col-2 term"><h6>Ecosystem Services</h6></div>

        <div class="col-10 col-md-9 offset-md-0 definition-text">The likelihood of hazard events occurring. Probabilities have traditionally been determined from the historic frequency of events.
