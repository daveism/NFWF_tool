            The National Coastal Resilience Assessment was developed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and UNC Ashevilleâ€™s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center (NEMAC) and in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NatureServe. The Assessment seeks to identify areas on the landscape where the implementation of nature-based solutions have potential to maximize benefits for human community resilience and fish and wildlife habitat. In 2019, NFWF launched CREST to share regional assessment results for the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coastlines using a standardized methodology to combine information about flooding threats, human community assets, and fish and wildlife species to identify Resilience Hubs. The Assessment has since expanded to include Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Owing to the uniqueness of each region and the availability of new methodological approaches, the methods continue to be refined and enhanced. CREST will be updated regularly as additional Assessments are completed in Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Alaska, and the Great Lakes.

              Resilience Hubs are areas of open space where resilience projects may have the greatest potential to benefit both human community resilience and fish and wildlife. The Hubs combine information about natural open spaces, flooding threats, community assets, and fish and wildlife resources. As the primary output of the National Coastal Resilience Assessment, Resilience Hubs are common to all regions. However, the methods used to develop Resilience Hubs do vary regionally, with significant methodological enhancements made in Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

              The Community Exposure Index explores the relationship between potential flooding threats and the presence of community assets by multiplying two composite indices: the Threat Index and the Community Asset Index. The Community Asset Index helps to understand where critical infrastructure, facilities, and population are concentrated on the landscape. The Threat Index utilizes landscape characteristics and flood-related data. Together, these indices combine to identify areas where community assets overlap with flood threats, also known as exposure. While individual data inputs vary regionally, the National Coastal Resilience Assessment utilizes standardized methods to calculate the Index.

              The Fish and Wildlife Index identifies areas on the landscape where species and their habitat are located, thus helping to understand areas where implementing nature-based solutions are likely to benefit federally or state designated species of concern. While the National Coastal Resilience Assessment consistently combines species data to create a single Fish and Wildlife Index, methods vary significantly between the continental US (CONUS) and other regional assessments. In CONUS, a Terrestrial and Aquatic Index are combined based principally on rarity-weighted richness. Importantly, in CONUS, the Aquatic Index includes both freshwater and marine species, but focuses almost exclusively on very shallow, nearshore areas.

            <div class="about-main-text col-12 col-md-12">
              Implementing significant methodological enhancements, regional assessments in Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands combine a Terrestrial and Marine Index. Unlike CONUS, the enhanced Terrestrial Index attempts to identify suitable habitat based the habitat preferences of major taxonomic groups including freshwater species (e.g., birds, reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fishes and invertebrates). The enhanced Marine Index considers habitat to a 30m bathymetry boundary, utilizing the best available data to identify marine habitat types capable of supporting significant biodiversity (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves, and sea grass beds). CREST automatically displays the results for each region based on the methods applied. For details, see <a href="/#Download" >final reports</a>.
